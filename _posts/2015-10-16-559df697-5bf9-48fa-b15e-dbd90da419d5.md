[Heirs of Empire][0] is my latest novel, a science fiction adventure story set in the interior of a Dyson Cloud, a somewhat popular concept these days since the discovery of [WTF 001][1]. Yeah. Scientists actually created a new labeling category for stars called WTF. If I put that in one of my books, no one would have believed it.

Oh well, I guess I now know what to call the Autolycus' mission profile. Operation WTF. Captain Passer is going to LOVE that.

The idea of a Dyson Construct is a fascinating one, and one potential sign of a Type 2 Kardeshev Civilization, the sort of culture that can tap the entire power potential of a solar system. [WTF 001][1] is probably a string of proto comets, but it also matches the expected signature of a Dyson Cloud or Ring in mid construction, so you can bet we'll be watching [WTF 001][1] for the foreseeable future.
